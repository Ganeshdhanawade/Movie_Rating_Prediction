# Project Title : Movie-Ratings-Prediction-using-Autoencoder

## Overview:
This project involves building a movie rating prediction model using Autoencoder neural networks. The code for this project was developed as part of the "Deep Learning A-Z 2023: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT Prize" course on Udemy. I have made the necessary changes by adding some more lines of code and comments while practicing and building it.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Instructions:

### Using Google Colab:
1. Open the `Movie_Rating_Prediction_Autoencoder.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code.
3. View the results and predictions.

### Using Jupyter Notebook:
1. Download the `Movie_Rating_Prediction_Autoencoder.ipynb` notebook.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x, TensorFlow, Keras, and other required libraries installed.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code.
5. View the results and predictions.

## Acknowledgments:
This project was created based on the knowledge gained from the "Deep Learning A-Z 2023: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT Prize" course on Udemy. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to them for providing valuable insights and knowledge throughout the course. Their guidance has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of neural networks and AI.

## Dataset: 
The dataset used in this project was provided as part of the course. The dataset itself is not included in this repository. If you are enrolled in the course, you can find the dataset in the course materials. Follow the instructions provided in the course to download and use the dataset.  
Note: Please respect the course's terms of use and distribution regarding the dataset.
